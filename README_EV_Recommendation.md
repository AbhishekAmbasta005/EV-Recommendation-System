# 🚗 EV Recommendation System using Python

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to build an **Electric Vehicle (EV) Recommendation System** that suggests the most suitable EV models to users based on their preferences, such as budget, range, battery capacity, and brand. The goal is to help potential buyers make data-driven decisions while exploring the growing EV market.

The model leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to recommend electric vehicles that best match user requirements.

## 🧩 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of EV dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and performance  
- Feature engineering for better recommendations  
- Similarity-based recommendation using cosine similarity  
- Interactive user input to get personalized EV suggestions  
- Visualization of EV performance metrics such as price vs range

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning and similarity computation  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## 🧪 Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Imported dataset of electric vehicles with attributes like brand, model, price, range, and battery capacity.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized numeric columns.  
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Analyzed key factors influencing EV adoption.  
4. **Feature Engineering** – Encoded categorical data and normalized numerical features.  
5. **Modeling** – Built a **cosine similarity-based recommendation model** that finds vehicles similar to user preferences.  
6. **Evaluation** – Tested system with multiple user scenarios to ensure accurate recommendations.

## 💡 Key Insights
- EVs with higher range and moderate pricing show better recommendation scores.  
- Brand reputation and battery efficiency play a significant role in consumer choice.  
- Cosine similarity provided effective personalized results based on user input.
